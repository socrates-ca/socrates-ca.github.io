    ### Inclusiveness

    A primary goal of SoCraTes conference is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

    ### Safe Environment

    As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

    And so we invite all those who participate in the SoCraTes conference and the community surrounding the conference to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

    - **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
    - **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
    - **Be aware of the effect your words may have on others.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior arenâ€™t acceptable.

    ### Scope

    This code of conduct applies to the SoCraTes conference itself and to all digital spaces that are related to the SoCraTes conference, such as the wiki and mailing list.
