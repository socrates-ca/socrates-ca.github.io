    The conference starts on **Friday 13th at 2pm** and ends on **Sunday 15th at 4pm**.

    ### Format

    The event will be run as a two day [Open Space](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace).

    Open Space means there is no agenda, or rather: **you set the agenda**. This is your time, make the best of it! For ideas about what you can do in advance have a look at [this article](http://unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/).

    Facilitation will be in English. However, it will be possible to run sessions in other languages.

    ### Evening activities

    Participants organize evening activities. In other events like this one, there were a multitude of things going on in the evenings: from music, over board games to live-hacking programs. And of course thereâ€™s always plenty of people to just talk to, or continue discussions from the day.
