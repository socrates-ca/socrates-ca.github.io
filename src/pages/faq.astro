          Here are some common questions you may have. We also have <a
            href="https://github.com/socrates-ca/socrates-ca.github.io/wiki">a wiki</a
          > you can explore.
        </p>

            <div class="space-content text-lg">
              <p>Your ticket includes</p>
              <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
                <li>Two nights (from October 4th to 6th) at Selenia Lodge</li>

              <p>
                Tickets can be refunded until August 15. After that date, we may not be able to refund you (because of
                catering).
              </p>
              <p>Tickets have no name attached to them. You can give yours to someone else if you can't attend.</p>
              <p>
                We do not make any profit from the ticket price. <a href="/#sponsors">Our sponsors</a> help us keep the price
                reasonable for a 2-day code retreat in a typical lodge of the Laurentides, during Canadian Fall üçÅ

                As a participant, you have an individual room. Each room includes a Queen bed. Therefore, if you want to
                go with your loved one, it is totally possible. In fact, you can bring anyone, as long as you share the
                bed.

                They may or may not attend the unconference. If they don't, they can still enjoy the cabin and
                surroundings for the weekend.
              </p>
              <p>
                If they attend the lunches and dinner, there is an extra fee to cover for the catering (typically, half
                the full-ticket price).
